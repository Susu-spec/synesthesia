# synesthesia

A music visualiser which maps audio effects to visuals.

The frontend was created using [React](https://react.dev/).

## Resources Used
- [My first draft of the project in p5](https://github.com/Susu-spec/synesthesia-v0)
- A little more Google searching for design inspiration.

## Future Development
- Instructions for users.
- Add an input button for audio.
- Reduce lag.
- A lot more styling.

### General Notes
I made this site for two reasons. One was because I thought it would be cool to see a some music visualisations and two because I wanted to learn React. I'm mostly excited about the first reason.
